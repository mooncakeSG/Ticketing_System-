## WebSocket Configuration

The real-time features are configured to work in production by default. For development:

### Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_AUTO_CONNECT=true` - Enable WebSocket auto-connect in development
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001` - WebSocket server URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_DEBUG=true` - Enable WebSocket debug logging

### Development Setup
1. Create a WebSocket server on port 3001 (or configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`)
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_AUTO_CONNECT=true` in `.env.local` to enable features
3. Features will work automatically in production
